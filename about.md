**About Tim**

_By day a clinical trial programmer, by night a freelance web developer!_

After completing my Degree in Computer Science from University of Nottingham in 2006, I and worked at Solid State Logic as a software engineer, programmming micro controllers and developing desktop applications. In 2009 I joined Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford as the IT Officer and Web Developer, providing IT support and developing web based tools to facilitate the research and teaching interests of the department. In March 2013 I moved to Surgical Trials Interventions Unit (within Dept of Surgical Sciences) as Web Developer. In 2014 I joined Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit working as part of the programming team developing clinical trial IT Systems. I also work on individual trials providing programming support, ensuring that the IT Systems aspect of a clinical trial runs smoothly. 

When not glued to my screen I enjoy spending time with my family, running and playing cricket... Howzat!
