**About Tim**

_By day a clinical trial programmer, by night a freelance web developer!_

After completing my Degree in Computer Science from University of Nottingham in 2006, I worked Solid State Logic as a software engineer, programmming micro controllers and developing desktop applications. In 2009 I joined Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford as the IT Officer and Web Developer, providing IT support and developing web based tools to facilitate the research and teaching interests of the department. In March 2013 I moved to the Surgical Trials Interventions Unit (SITU), Universty of Oxford, as Web Developer. Whilst with SITU I established a brand and web presence for the newly formed Unit. In 2014 I joined Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU), University of Oxford. In OCTRU I work in the programming team developing clinical trial IT Systems, maintaining our server infrustrute and working on individual trials providing programming support, ensuring that the IT Systems aspect of a clinical trial runs smoothly. 

When not glued to my screen I enjoy spending time with my family, running and playing cricket... Howzat!
